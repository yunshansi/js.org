**Claiming a subdomain for your project**

Please read over [README.md](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/blob/master/README.md) for general instructions on claiming a `js.org` subdomain.

Before creating your pull request please review the following items and ensure you are in the clear with your request:
* What subdomain should you request: [Subdomain Determination](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki/Subdomain-Determination)
* Is your site ready for a `js.org` subdomain: [No Content](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki/No-Content)
* Are you happy with the Terms and Conditions of `js.org`: [Terms and Conditions](http://js.org/terms.html)

When creating your pull request, ensure that you are merging your forked and edited `master` branch into the `master` branch of the base `js.org` repository.
Please see the wiki article [Branch Error](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki/Branch-Error) for further information regarding this.
